## Introduction:
Our project MOODIFY is based on the idea of automating the interaction between the music player and its user by using openCV and other python libraries as humans have a tendency to listen to music in accordance to their mood. So our project would be helpful as it is “smart enough” to sort-out the music based on the current state of emotion the person is having.

At last we are giving Music Market place for minting NFT's .
